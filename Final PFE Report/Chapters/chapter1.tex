\section{Study Of The Existing}
Shopify is a popular e-Commerce platform that allows individuals and businesses to create online stores effortlessly. Among its many advantages are the performant templates that ensure fast loading times and a seamless shopping experience for customers.
\newline

In addition to high-performing templates, Shopify offers a variety of sales-boosting features. These include abandoned cart recovery, targeted email campaigns, and advanced analytics. These tools help store owners optimize their online sales and increase revenue.
\newline

Furthermore, Shopify provides a comprehensive mobile app that allows store owners to manage their business on the go. The app includes features like order management, product updates, and sales tracking, making it convenient to maintain an online store anytime, anywhere.

\section{Problem Statement} 
Despite Converty's notable progress in the e-commerce industry, the product currently faces several critical challenges that must be addressed to compete effectively with Shopify. 
\begin{itemize} 
    \item \textbf{Performance Issues:} One of the four templates provided by Converty has performance problems that negatively affect the overall user experience. 
    \item \textbf{Missing Key Features:} The platform lacks essential features such as upselling, which are critical to maximizing sales and improving customer satisfaction. 
    \item \textbf{Incomplete Mobile App Experience:} The mobile app experience is incomplete, limiting accessibility and convenience for users who prefer to manage their online stores on mobile devices. 
\end{itemize} 
Addressing these challenges is crucial for Converty to fully leverage its potential and offer a robust, competitive solution in the e-commerce market.

\section{Proposed Solution}
After a long discussion with the company, the following fixes were decided to be made:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Performance Optimization:} The first template will be recoded using React to enhance performance. This will involve refactoring the codebase to improve efficiency and responsiveness, leading to a significantly better user experience.
  \item \textbf{Upsell Feature Integration:} An upsell feature will be added to the platform, incorporating algorithms and interfaces that recommend complementary products to customers. This feature aims to increase the average order value and boost customer satisfaction.
  \item \textbf{Mobile App Enhancements:} Key mobile features will be incorporated to complete the mobile app experience, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user interface for managing online stores on mobile devices.
\end{itemize}

These solutions address the critical issues facing Converty, improving its performance, functionality, and overall user experience in the competitive e-commerce market.

\hline
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Advantages} & \textbf{Disadvantages} & \textbf{Suitability} \\
\hline

\hline
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Advantages} & \textbf{Disadvantages} & \textbf{Suitability} \\
\hline
\endhead
Waterfall Model & Simple and easy to understand and use & Inflexible, difficult to make changes once the process is underway & Suitable for small projects with well-defined requirements \\
\hline
Agile Model & Flexible and adaptive to changes, promotes collaboration and customer feedback & Can be difficult to predict effort required and can lead to scope creep & Suitable for projects with dynamic requirements \\
\hline
Scrum Model & Iterative approach promotes continuous improvement, increases team accountability & Requires experienced team members, can be difficult to implement for complex projects & Suitable for complex projects requiring frequent changes \\
\hline
Kanban Model & Visual workflow management, promotes continuous delivery & Lack of time frames can lead to lack of urgency & Suitable for projects needing continuous delivery and improvement \\
\hline

\subsubsection{Agile Methodology}
The Agile methodology emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, customer feedback, and rapid releases. It supports adaptive planning and continuous improvement, making it ideal for dynamic and complex projects. Agile encourages iterative development cycles (sprints) that allow teams to adapt quickly to changing requirements and deliver functional software incrementally.

\subsubsection{Scrum Framework}
The Scrum framework, a subset of Agile, manages complex product development through iterative cycles known as sprints, which typically last 2-4 weeks. Key roles in Scrum include the Product Owner (responsible for project vision and backlog prioritization), the Scrum Master (facilitates the process and resolves issues), and the Development Team (completes the work). Scrum ceremonies such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives ensure ongoing progress and improvement.

  \label{fig:Scrum Framework}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Scrum Tools}
To support the Scrum framework, the following tools were utilized:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GitHub:} For version control and collaborative code management, allowing team members to work on code simultaneously, track changes, and manage issues.
    \item \textbf{Google Meet:} For virtual meetings including daily stand-ups, sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives, ensuring remote team members can collaborate effectively.
    \item \textbf{Notion:} An all-in-one workspace for project management, documentation, and collaboration, helping organize tasks, track progress, and maintain a shared knowledge base.
\end{itemize}
