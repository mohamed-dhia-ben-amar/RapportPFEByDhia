\chapter{General Introduction}

During the past decade, the e-commerce industry in the MENA region has experienced significant growth. However, the development and adoption of online payment services have not kept pace with this expansion, leading to a substantial gap between demand and availability. As a result, cash-on-delivery (COD) has become the predominant payment method, fueling the sector's growth.

E-Commerce platforms like Shopify are well known for their dominance in online retail, especially in the drop shipping sector. Despite its flexibility, Shopify’s extensive feature set can cause performance issues and a steep learning curve for new users. The high number of applications required for various functionalities, each with its own subscription fee, presents a barrier to small businesses. Moreover, the platform’s level of abstraction makes extensive customization challenging.

To address these challenges, Converty was created with a focus on enhancing user efficiency and customization. Converty offers a comprehensive CRM and CMS platform designed to streamline the creation of high-converting online stores and manage all aspects of a business from a single platform. This approach eliminates the need for coding, spreadsheets, and additional applications, simplifying the management process.

During my six-month internship at Converty, I worked on resolving critical issues within the CRM and CMS dashboards, addressing performance-related concerns, and completing the mobile app experience. My tasks included enhancing existing features, implementing new functionalities, and improving the overall user experience on the dashboard and the mobile app.
